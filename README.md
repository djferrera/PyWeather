Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp: Python and API Assignment

The WeatherPy assignment analyzed data from over 500 world cities to look at the correlation of equator proximity on a variety of weather statistics. The cities, varying in latitudes were selected at random.

It must be prefaced that all data is somewhat skewed as it was generated on August 16th, while the Northern Hemisphere was at the height of summer and the Southern Hemisphere was in the dead of winter. Had data from mid December been utilized, it is expected that Northern and Southern results would be reversed. 

Results are as expected...
Temperatures rise as you get nearer to the equator. The top, left scatter plot denotes that within 20° (both north and south) of the equator, the majority of temperatures fall between 60° and 90°F. As apparent in the remaining three scatter plots, equator proximity appears to have no effect on humidity, wind speed or cloudiness.

Also worth noting, the randomized data appears to account for more cities located in the Norther Hemispehe. Studies show that the majority of the world’s population resides in the North (some stating as much as 90%), so it would be safe to conclude there are more Northern cities than Southern cities to choose from.
